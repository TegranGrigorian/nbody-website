This is the source code for the NBody Simulator website, built using Flask. It includes routes for various pages, including documentation and an about page.

## Features
- Homepage for advertising the NBody Simulator project.
- Documentation pages for the NBody Simulator and its GUI.
- An about page providing information about the project and its source code repositories.
- Installation instructions and usage guides.

## Final Notes / Future plans
Eventually, I will expand this site to contain downloadable packages, forums, version control, patch notes and more. In terms of the engine and GUI, I plan to add a recording feature, faster simulation speeds, multithreading in the engine and GUI, and more UX improvements.
